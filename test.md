# Test File

This file was originally empty. It has been updated to serve as a basic test file.

## Purpose
- Placeholder for test cases
- Example of proper file structure
- Foundation for test framework implementation

## Usage
This file can be expanded to include:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests  
- Test configuration
- Test data

## Status
- Created as part of issue resolution framework
- Ready for actual test implementation when requirements are clarified

## Test Framework Setup

To implement proper testing, consider:

1. **Choose a testing framework** (Jest, pytest, JUnit, etc.)
2. **Create test directories** organized by feature/module
3. **Add test configuration** files
4. **Implement CI/CD** for automated testing
5. **Add test coverage** reporting

## Example Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── fixtures/
└── config/
```
